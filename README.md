# DLA interface

This is the repository for the DLA (Distributed Linear Algebra) interface code.
The goal is to provide a generic interface to the existing distributed linear algebra libraries.
E.g.:
- Scalapack (Not yet supported)
- D-Plasma (Not yet supported)
- Chameleon (Not yet supported)

Unfortunately we do not have thorough documentation of how-to guides yet.
